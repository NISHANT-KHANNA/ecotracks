## 🖥️ How It Works

1. **User speaks** into the microphone (e.g., "Show me trains from Delhi to Mumbai").
2. **Voice input is captured** via the Web Speech API and converted into a text query.
3. The system **fetches train data** via integrated railway APIs.
4. Results are **displayed on screen** and can also be **spoken aloud** using Text-to-Speech.
